# Aurora Skincare — 3.8x ROAS

**Problem:** Rising CPAs, weak creative fatigue, leaking LP.  
**Hypothesis:** UGC-first ads + benefit-led LP sections will lift CTR and CVR.

## Plan
- Sourced 6 creators, scripted 2 hooks each.
- Iterated first frames, captions, and CTA overlays.
- Shipped LP variants (social proof, “why it works”, before/after).

## Outcome
- CTR: **+42%**
- CVR: **+28%**
- ROAS: **1.4x → 3.8x** in 6 weeks

### Summary
- UGC pipeline beats studio creative for speed.
- Tight loop: creative learnings → LP copy blocks → retests.
