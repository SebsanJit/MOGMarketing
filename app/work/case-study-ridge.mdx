# Ridge Fitness — CPA ↓ 33%

**Problem:** High CPA on meta; landing pages not aligned to ad promise.

## Plan
- Hook testing matrix for 15s UGC spots.
- Added quiz-style LP hero + risk reversal.
- Built post-purchase upsell.

## Outcome
- CPA: **-33%**
- AOV: **+18%**
- Email capture rate: **+2.3x**

### Summary
Fast UGC iteration + landing page congruence = predictable wins.
